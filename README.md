# Pitchlane Video Library

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Web App

The web app is hosted on the following URL: https://pitchlane-frontend.vercel.app

The app takes up to 2â€“5 seconds to upload a video, and, after the upload, the user needs to refresh to see the video appear in the library. Note: The app can only take a video smaller than 5 MBs at the moment, a task on which I would like to improve.
